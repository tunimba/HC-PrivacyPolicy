# 1. What Data We Use

We do not collect or retain any personal or biometric data from users.

The following types of data are processed temporarily and only to provide the core functionality of the app:

Face data is never stored or extracted. The photos are used only to apply the requested transformation and are deleted after processing.

# 2. How We Process Your Photos

Temporary processing: Uploaded photos are sent temporarily to our third-party AI provider, Replicate, Inc., for hairstyle transformation.
No storage: Once the transformation is complete, the image is returned to your device and the photo is automatically discarded.
No biometric analysis: The app does not extract or analyze facial features for identification or profiling purposes.
No human review: All processing is handled by automated models. We do not access or view your images unless you explicitly contact our support team for help.
